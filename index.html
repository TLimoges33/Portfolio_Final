            <p>My name is Ty Limoges </p>
            <p>Writer//Anesthesia Technician//Hockey Goalie</p>
            <p>
              I have been working with computers all my life, my earliest childhood memory is being awoken in the middle of the night in my parent's first apartment by the dial-up modem so my Dad (who gave me my building blocks in Computer Sciences as apart of his curriculum practice for high school students) I have been coding since I was 10 years old, starting on tiny side projects getting like Linux on iPod Nano, and not bricking it, or fixing small computer issues for family and friends; introducing many to a duel boot and the joys of open source Operating Systems like Ubuntu to many.</p>
            <p>
              But, now I'm getting more serious about changing career paths from healthcare into tech. Currently gaining a better understanding of Web Development and Design, and concepts of Cybersecurity, studying that very major at Southern New Hampshire University; to pay the bills while studying: I spend my days in the Operating Room at UMass Memorial Medical Center's Level 1 Trauma Center and Children's hospital where I specialize in teaching techs and residents as a Trauma Resusitation Protocol and Stop the Bleed instructor. This site is to be considered as a portfolio of some of my finest digital work, the healthcare magic I can bring to the table remains behind closed doors, unless an emergancy presents itself.
            </p>
            <p>Here are some of my favorite project that I've worked on: </p>
            <p>iPod Linux (Podzilla Import; to play Duke Nukem 3D on iPod Nano)</p>
            <p>Linux: BlackArch on PC, Kali rootless install on Samsung s21</p>
